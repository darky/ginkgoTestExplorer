## Setup your machine

### Using docker

First time only:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Enter on container:
```bash
docker-compose exec server bash
```

## Visual Studio Code

If you are using VS Code, I strongly recommend you install the following plugin:
- [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) - use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment.
- [ESLint plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - which will enable you to view ESLint errors directly in your editor.

To unleash the true powers of ESLint and Prettier, we can configure VS Code so that it auto-corrects ESLint errors.
You should tell VS Code not to formatOnSave, but instead fix ESLint errors on save.
```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": false,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    }
}
```

## Build

Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn

## Deploy

```bash

```

Packages extension:
```bash

Publishes extension:

## Create a commit

Commit messages should be well formatted, and to make that "standardized", we
are using Conventional Commits.

You can follow the documentation on
[their website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

## Submit a pull request

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-feature
